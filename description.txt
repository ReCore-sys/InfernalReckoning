Infernal Reckoning is a mod based around ritual and sacrifice. Currently it is in beta meaning not much will work and some items will be unobtainable like the boss summoner. I also need to do balancing so that will be a pain.

Changelog:
0.1.2: Turns out, it's hard to debug when terraria does not work. The altar sprite was messed up in the last update but now it's fixed. Also changed Eligos's projectile from a demon scyth to a custom projectile. Damage also doubled and idk why. Have fun with that.

0.1.1: Improved altar sprite and changed the tooltip of the boltor rounds.

0.1: Mod was created and added stuff like a boss, a couple guns and spirit dropping. The spirit is an item for now but later it will be something that is stored in an accessory.
