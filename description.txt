Infernal Reckoning is a mod based around ritual and sacrifice. Currently it is in beta meaning not much will work and some items will be unobtainable. I also need to do balancing so that will be a pain. Oh and excuse the altar sprite, it's a placeholder till one of the guys does a better one.

Changelog:
0.1: Mod was created and added stuff like a boss, a couple guns and spirit dropping. The spirit is an item for now but later it will be something that is stored in an accessory.
