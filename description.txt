Infernal Reckoning is a mod based around ritual and sacrifice. Currently it is in beta meaning not much will work and some items will be unobtainable like the boss summoner. I also need to do balancing so that will be a pain.

Changelog:
0.2.0: I though this way cool enough to warrant a "minor update" title. Spirit is now a thing! You get it from murdering stuff and can use it in crafting and weapons. Later I will do some method of showing you how much Spirit you need for each item to craft. Also redid the boss's AI so now you are all well and truly fucked. But now now drops some pretty cool loot.

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
0.1.2: Turns out, it's hard to debug when terraria does not work. The altar sprite was messed up in the last update but now it's fixed. Also changed Eligos's projectile from a demon scyth to a custom projectile. Damage also doubled and idk why. Have fun with that.

0.1.1: Improved altar sprite and changed the tooltip of the boltor rounds.

0.1: Mod was created and added stuff like a boss, a couple guns and spirit dropping. The spirit is an item for now but later it will be something that is stored in an accessory.
