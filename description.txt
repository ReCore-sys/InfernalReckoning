Infernal Reckoning is a mod based around ritual and sacrifice. Currently it is in beta meaning not much will work and some items will be unobtainable. I also need to do balancing so that will be a pain. But for now, you can suffer.
Questions? Bugs? Ideas? Come see us in the discord server! The website below is a link to the server.
We also need spriters cos we don't have enough. Any skill level is welcome. We also need playtesters cos I am bad at the game and have no clue how to do the balancing.

Currently there is no in-game way to find out how much spirit is needed to craft each item. For now there will be a list on the discord. A guide in-game is in the works.

Changelog:
0.2.1.4: Honestly take a guess at why I am pushing updates at the speed of sound

0.2.1.3: Github can go die in a hole

0.2.1.2: Bug fixes 4 days

0.2.1: So I lost a large chunk of code and sprites thanks to github. I got most of it back but there might be a few changes. I might release a few updates fixing those. Anyway, I also changed the Vorax a bit cos the North Pole was way too OP. Enjoy!

0.2.0: I though this way cool enough to warrant a "minor update" title. Spirit is now a thing! You get it from murdering stuff and can use it in crafting and weapons. Later I will do some method of showing you how much Spirit you need for each item to craft. Also changed the boss's AI so have fun with that.

0.1.2: Turns out, it's hard to debug when terraria does not work. The altar sprite was messed up in the last update but now it's fixed. Also changed Eligos's projectile from a demon scyth to a custom projectile. Damage also doubled and idk why. Have fun with that.

0.1.1: Improved altar sprite and changed the tooltip of the boltor rounds.

0.1: Mod was created and added stuff like a boss, a couple guns and spirit dropping. The spirit is an item for now but later it will be something that is stored in an accessory.
